Impact Forecasting United States Tropical Cyclone Model
Event Response Oasis Package

Overview

Hurricanes produce the most widespread destruction from a single event for the United States. Impact Forecastingâ€™s US hurricane model uses a Willoughby-based method to numerically model wind speeds. They are validated against weather station measurements - one-minute average (sustained wind speeds) and three-second average (peak wind gusts). Impact Forecasting relies on National Hurricane Center (NHC) best track data to produce in-season scenarios and considers additional information including observations and storm size. Wind station measurements are subject to uncertainties due to station failure caused by high winds, power outages and physical damage.

This model package is freely available to all users and supports only general vulnerability/damage functions. Occupancy, construction, year built, and number of stories are assumed to be unknown. Users do not need to edit their existing portfolios as the model will override any provided modifier values.
