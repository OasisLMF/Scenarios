Impact Forecasting Morocco Earthquake Model
Event Response Oasis Package

Overview

The Impact Forecasting Morocco Earthquake Event Response Model is a part of the regional Maghreb earthquake model and it is developed in collaboration with Aon Natural Hazard Centre in Pretoria.

A magnitude-6.8 earthquake occurred in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountain range near Ouka√Ømedene on September 8. Earthquakes of this size are rare but not unexpected in the region. As of September 11, the earthquake claimed approximately 2,500 fatalities and injuries and caused notable material damage across the affected area, however, unlikely to be a major event for the insurance industry regarding low insurance penetration.

This model provides three footprints for the event, one based on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shakemap and two based on Global Earthquake Model (GEM) fault parameters. Each is contained in a separate event set. By use of this model, clients are afforded the capability to quantify earthquake loss potential in Morocco from a deterministic point of view.
